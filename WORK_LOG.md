| Sep 11 | 9:15-9:45pm | I first started by thinking about the problem whether to traverse nodes or edges. I realized that the only information I need to find is the number of subgraphs, so I brainstormed an algorithmic approach to build "subgraphs" using the edges provides. This involves iterating over cities, mapping each node to the root node of its subgraph, and adding/merging subgraphs when needed. I realized half an hour later that I forgot to commit! Hope this is ok. |

I wrote my central logic loop and implemented algorithms to quickly calculate the cost without knowing the number of highways in each subgraph. I also made a subgraph class to keep track of each subgraph and its root node. At this point my code passes 2 of the 6 test cases with the failed cases being underestimated by the cost method. |

We compared runtimes and whether n choose 2 or n^2 was better. I then spent some time removing my unnecessary for loops inside of my cost function, which should improve my run time. I unfortunately didn't have time in class to finish testing. |
